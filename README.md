# TicTacToe

This android app is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. PLayer one and player two take turns to place a cross or a circle, respectively. 
The game ends when there are three of the same symbols in a row or when the button grid is filled. 
When it's game over, the grid buttons are unclickable and only the reset button can be clicked.

The player's turn is displayed above the grid
